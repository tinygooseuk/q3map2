* Q3Map2

This program takes an idTech3-style  /.map/ file and spits out a /.bsp/ file suitable for loading into many different engines based on idTech3. 

Modified by Tiny Goose for the Tremble Unity Asset.
Changes:
- Add support for "Valve 220" format maps.
- Remove dependency on WebP (we only use PNG)
